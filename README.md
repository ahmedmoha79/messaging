# LOGISTICS MESSAGING AND TRACKING APP

**A real-time chat application with integrated location tracking**, built in 4 days by [beyhaqi_moha](https://github.com/beyhaqi_moha) (high school graduate) using only Deepseek AI

## Key Features

- **Secure Messaging**: Private conversations with read receipts and typing indicators
- **Live Location Tracking**: Real-time GPS updates with battery-efficient polling
- **Minimalist Interface**: Clean UI that prioritizes functionality
- **Reliable Infrastructure**: Built on Supabase with proper Row-Level Security

## Technical Details

As a high school graduate with no formal training, I developed this application in just four days using:

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript with Leaflet.js for maps
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL database with RLS policies)
- **Realtime Updates**: Supabase's websocket connections
- **Authentication**: JWT with proper session management

## What Makes This Impressive

Most professional teams would require *significantly more time* to build something with this level of functionality. The system demonstrates:

1. **Complex real-time data synchronization**
2. **Proper security implementation** 
3. **Efficient location tracking**
4. **Clean state management**
5. **Responsive design**

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a Supabase project
3. Configure your environment variables
4. Import the database schema
5. Deploy to your preferred hosting service
